# Qilin.Cloud/API/Product

The Product API is used to manage products. A product is the base of an item. It describes an item in general, which means that it is not merchant-specific: Many merchants can use the same product to make their respective offers on it. Offers are merchant-specific.
The Product describes the details of an item, regardless of the channel used.
