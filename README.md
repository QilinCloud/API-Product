# Qilin.Cloud/API/Product

## Description

The Product API is used to manage products. A product is the base of an item. It describes an item in general, which means that it is not merchant-specific: Many merchants can use the same product to make their respective offers on it. Offers are merchant-specific.
The Product describes the details of an item, regardless of the channel used.

### :bulb: Example:

*The product is titled "Coca Cola, Glass Bottle, 0.4L". It is from the brand "Coca Cola" (manufacturer: "The CocaCola Company"). It is a caffeinated, sweet fizzy drink that has been carbonated. The jar is made of white clear glass and contains 0.4L. The nutritional value is 433 kJ per bottle. It has a grain cork as a closure and weighs 715g including packaging. Its height is 15cm and its diameter is 6.2cm.. This and similar product data are managed by the Product API.*

## Version

The current API version is: **1.0.1**

## Code Quality

We use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques to ensure that our code meets the highest quality criteria.
Some examples are:

- [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- [Clean as you code:tm: approach](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/)
- 4-eyes approval on QC
- Semiautomated Unit-, Integration- and End2End-tests
- positive tests / negative tests / destructive tests in aware of false positive results / false negative results
- Sonarcloud
